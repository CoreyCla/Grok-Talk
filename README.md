# Grok-Talk
A forum website made with C# and ASP.NET to be used with a database to store threads and comments.

This website allows for comments on comments through comment object inheritence. The skeleton of the website is there to be added
onto if needed. Admins will need to download bootstrap and add it to the /wwwroot folder in order to get the full aesthetic of the 
thread and comment views. Also make sure to create and link a database using the Entity Core Framework's connection string.

Below are some screenshots of the tests that passed and thread/comment pages:
